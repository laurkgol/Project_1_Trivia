 ##Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **2: Performing.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **2: Performing.** More than surpassed the minimal requirements. You definitely pushed yourself here! I love
 the use of data structures for the questions and objects to contain functionality / properties. I would suggest
 continuing to add features like maybe giving the option to restart, randomly shuffling the questions each time
 a user plays, and printing notifications ('correct' / 'incorrect') to some element in the DOM instead
 of via alerts. Overall truly great job though.

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **2: Performing.** Your code is well organized, neatly written, and free of bugs. There are a few opportunities
 for refactoring code and modularization, but overall excellent code.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **3: Excelling.** Your app is very neatly styled and has examples of many modern UI elements. I like that
 you used a normalize.css for cross-browser compatibility. Only possible improvements would be to make it
 responsive so that when resized, it alters its layout to adapt (check flexbox and media queries) and to
 create a UI element for notifications (like when the user answers correctly and gains points).
